# DSA Practice

Welcome to the DSA Practice repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through a collection of problem-solving questions. By solving these questions, you can enhance your understanding and proficiency in DSA concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have a basic understanding of data structures and algorithms. If you are new to DSA, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals before attempting the practice questions.

Each day, a new problem will be added to the repository, sourced from GeeksforGeeks' Problem of the Day. You can find the problem description, example inputs, and expected outputs in the respective solution files.

## Viewing Solutions

To view the solutions for the daily problems, you can navigate to the specific date's folder and find the solution file. The solutions are provided in various programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, etc. Feel free to explore and compare your solutions with the provided ones.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Practice.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd DSA-Practice
```

3. Open the problem of the day question name folder for the specific date you wish to solve:

```bash
cd potd question name
```

4. Read the problem description provided in the `README.md` file.

5. Implement your solution in the corresponding source file (`solution.cpp`, `solution.py`, etc.).

6. Test your solution with sample inputs to verify correctness.

7. Submit your solution by creating a pull request (PR) to the main repository. Make sure to include your solution file and any necessary explanations or additional test cases.
